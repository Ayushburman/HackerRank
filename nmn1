Sure, you can calculate the diagonal difference of the matrix [[2,3,6],[8,5,2],[9,5,1]] using the following steps:

Find the sum of the elements on the main diagonal. The main diagonal is the diagonal that runs from the top left corner to the bottom right corner. In this case, the main diagonal is 2 + 5 + 9 = 16.
Find the sum of the elements on the secondary diagonal. The secondary diagonal is the diagonal that runs from the bottom left corner to the top right corner. In this case, the secondary diagonal is 6 + 2 + 1 = 9.
Calculate the absolute difference between the two sums. In this case, the absolute difference is |16 - 9| = 7.
Therefore, the diagonal difference of the matrix [[2,3,6],[8,5,2],[9,5,1]] is 7.

Here is the Python code to calculate the diagonal difference of a square matrix:
